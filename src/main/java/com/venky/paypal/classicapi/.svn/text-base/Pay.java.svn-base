// # Pay API
// Use the Pay API operation to transfer funds from a sender's PayPal account to one or more receivers' PayPal accounts. You can use the Pay API operation to make simple payments, chained payments, or parallel payments; these payments can be explicitly approved, preapproved, or implicitly approved.
// This sample code uses AdaptivePayments Java SDK to make API call. You can
// download the SDK [here](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/tree/gh-pages/adaptivepayments-sdk/java)

		// 
		// * `Request Envelope` - Information common to each API operation, such
		// as the language in which an error message is returned.
		// * `Action Type` - The action for this request. Possible values are:
		//  * PAY - Use this option if you are not using the Pay request in
		//  combination with ExecutePayment.
		//  * CREATE - Use this option to set up the payment instructions with
		//  SetPaymentOptions and then execute the payment at a later time with
		//  the ExecutePayment.
		//  * PAY_PRIMARY - For chained payments only, specify this value to
		//  delay payments to the secondary receivers; only the payment to the primary
		//  receiver is processed.
		// * `Cancel URL` - URL to redirect the sender's browser to after
		// canceling the approval for a payment; it is always required but only
		// used for payments that require approval (explicit payments)
		// * `Currency Code` - The code for the currency in which the payment is
		// made; you can specify only one currency, regardless of the number of
		// receivers
		// * `Recevier List` - List of receivers
		// * `Return URL` - URL to redirect the sender's browser to after the
		// sender has logged into PayPal and approved a payment; it is always
		// required but only used if a payment requires explicit approval
